# PHP Standard Components

A series of libraries/components that form the basics of many website and most frameworks.

- [Router](doc/router.md)
- [Dependency Injection Container](doc/container.md)
- [Cache](doc/cache.md)
- [Fluent Query Builder](doc/querybuilder.md)
- [Logger](doc/logger.md)
- [Event Manager](doc/event.md)
- [Session and Flash Messages](doc/session.md)
- [Console](doc/console.md)

Their implementation is typically a common ground between features seen in major frameworks and is compliant with the relevant [FIG's PSRs](http://www.php-fig.org/psr) when applicable.
